Draw_Tools.py:

Contains the tools to draw the shapes onto the screen given the input from the file that we get from the Rust program.
For the time being, this will simply be, given a trio of positions, draw three circles (with random colors lol) and then
    connect them with a couple of black lines to test the linkages. 
Right now, I'm most interested in testing the Rust component, and the Python is just a way to visualize wtf is going on!

Note to Future Reader: If the documentation in this project is subpar, direct your compaints to thenatemartin@gmail.com. 
    It is literally my goal to not suck at documentation in this project, you hear?
